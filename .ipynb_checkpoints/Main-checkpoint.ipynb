APFK operate out of two public schools: PS 2 in Chinatown and PS 34 on the Lower East Side and offer an after-school program offering homework help and enrichment from 2:30 to 5:45 every day, as well as a 7 week summer program at PS 2.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOur programs have been sucessful due to the long standing relationships and collaborations with community based organizations and educational institutions such as: P.S. 2; P.S. 34; NYU; Confucius Institute of Pace University; BalaSole Dance Company; City-in-the Community - Chinatown/LES Soccer; and Asian American Youth Center and Asian Professionals for Excellence - McGraw-Hill. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur goal is to develop the minds and bodies of our children to their highest potential.

AGD provides externship programs where students can connect with private practices, clinics or hospitals for a week in the summer and learn more about the life of a dentist in their practice settings. AGD student chapter can also help students gain continuing education credits while in school. These continuing education credits can then be recorded by the official AGD transcript and can be used toward obtaining a Fellowship Award with the AGD that will help a dentist to stand out. Other AGD services include podcasts about interviews and industry news, online case studies for reviews, advocacy for the general dentists, and even the AGD blog written by one of AGD members. In partnership with Dentists Advantage, AGD even offers a free year of professional liability insurance to its members during their first year of practice. The student chapter will also organize multiple Lunch and Learn events at 4-6pm for a variety of topics proposed by members each year. \",\n",

This will be a tremendous experience that offers a lifetime membership into a professional society that will bring great benefits to all health practitioners in terms of education, patient referrals, treatment planning, etc. We will use this opportunity to expand our knowledge about the other professions and what role it can play in dentistry as well as educate others at our social events, seminars, symposiums, and workshops about our role in their professions and provide patient/practitioner referrals or advices to each other. There will be annual meetings amongst all ACE members from all participating schools. We will make it a priority to get to know each and every single member personally, and regard him or her as family. Our goal is to provide a platform where all health professionals can come together, enjoy each other’s company, help each other succeed by providing insight to our own personal experiences and treatments of our patients. We want other health professionals to understand more about dentistry and the role it can play in their related profession, and at the same time learn more about other professions.\\r\\n\",\n",

Originally founded as a secret society, it has now evolved into one of America's most unique fraternities with over 20,000 lifelong members. Alpha Phi Delta is also the largest fraternity in the Tri-State NY area, with over 10 chapters that are only a train ride away!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the Theta Beta chapter in NYU, Alpha Phi Delta prides itself with academic excellence and integrity from all brothers. Many of the brothers are some of the most outstanding students on their campuses, pursuing careers in politics, law, business, and the liberal arts, among other professions. Brothers have also been commended and acknowledged by the school for their many philanthropy related events, including but not limited to Relay for Life participation, Habitat for Humanity and a campus wide food and clothes drive. There have also been many instances where the chapter would also work with other student organizations on campus in philanthropic activities, such as fundraising for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf any are interested in joining, or merely checking out Alpha Phi Delta, please send us an email or a message on our Facebook website, and meet with us during Rush Week. It will be an opportunity to meet with the brothers, as well as a chance for us to get to know you better. Bring your friends to have fun with us, hang out, and find out if you have what it takes to become an Alpha man in our Fraternity.\",\n",

From the villages, plains, and mountains, to the skyscrapers, cities, and coasts in Syria, Egypt, Morocco, Yemen, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and so forth, Arabs are a people that are linked by a common identity that we at ASU treasure and wish to celebrate. Interestingly enough, we are also unique in ways that we cannot count. This is the essence of Arab Students United. We focus on culture, history, dialogue, and everything in between.\",\n",

As medical professionals, it is especially important that we engage with these conversations and consider their consequences for our lives professionally and personally. This club creates a space where we can share perspectives on death, and learn from the perspectives of people from within and outside the NYU medical community. By creating a space for this dialogue, we will be able to approach the lives and deaths of our patients with more openness and respect. \\r\\n\",\n",

Most of the club members are from the BMS major with a concentration in BioMedical Science. The Meet the Professional Series explores the many careers students can pursue in medicine, including allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine, research, Physician Assistant, and Physical Therapy. Besides this series, every semester the club co-hosts a Pre-Health Seminar where the Pre- Health Committee presents to the Pre-Med students the necessary requirement for application for the Committee Letter as well as Medical Professional Schools. Past students who have completed the application process share their experience and provide tips and advice to current students. This club fulfills the need for Pre-Health career advising usually seen in colleges under Pre-Med Clubs or Pre-Dental Clubs since the Polytechnic School of Engineering does not have a club which represents these students besides BMSC. This club is geared specifically for the School of Engineering Students, as the curriculum is different from the CAS students. BMSC shows how the students can use their education in engineering towards their advantage when applying to health- profession schools as well as talk about the specific research and volunteer opportunities that can be found here on campus and the Brooklyn neighborhood.\",\n",

      "    \"description\": \"\\\"Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art, combat sport, and a self defense system that focuses on grappling and especially ground fighting. Brazilian jiu-jitsu was formed from Kodokan Judo ground fighting (Ne-Waza) fundamentals that were taught to Carlos Gracie by master Mitsuyo Maeda. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu eventually came to be its own art through the experimentations, practices, and adaptation from the Judo knowledge of Carlos and Hélio Gracie, who then passed their knowledge on to their family.\\r\\n\\r\\nBJJ promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using leverage and proper technique, taking the fight to the ground – most notably by applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the other person. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments (gi and no-gi) and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition or self-defense. Sparring (commonly referred to as \\\"rolling\\\") and live drilling play a major role in training, and a premium is placed on performance, especially in competition, in relation to progress and ascension through its ranking system.\\\" (From Wikipedia)\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the Club: \\r\\nOur instruction focuses primarily on sport Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which emphasizes the use of chokeholds, joint-locks, controlling positions, escapes, agility techniques, and some takedowns/throws. \\r\\n\\r\\nClass will begin with approximately 15-20 min of warm-up. We will then cover movements and drills for about 20 minutes. These are meant to reinforce good technique and familiarity with the moves. Class will then proceed with the learning of new techniques, and will end with a session of rolling (active sparring) with different partners. \\r\\n\\r\\nClasses are approximately 1.25 hours long. We generally meet about three times a week. No special equipment is necessary to train, gym shorts and a t-shirt are perfectly fine. However, please refrain from wearing workout clothes that are too baggy, especially lose fitting t-shirts, as these can get caught during rolling, potentially causing injury.\",\n",

The Residential College at Goddard is organized around the vital theme of citizen engagement and our students affiliate with one of six themed \\\"streams,\\\" which range from social justice issues to \\\"Poverty & Affluence\\\" to affinity-based streams devoted to \\\"Writing New York\\\" or \\\"All the World's a Stage.\\\" Find out more about the residential college here. Six amazing Resident Assistants and Goddard’s “Faculty-Fellow-in-Residence” Carley Moore are visible and active members of the Goddard Residential College community.

Through innovative seminars, colloquia, and activities, the MSPHM enables students to pursue their creative and intellectual interests not necessarily covered in the core curriculum.  By approaching questions in medicine through the alternative lenses of the arts, humanities, and social sciences, the MSPHM emphasizes the shared humanity of all those involved in the delivery and receipt of health care. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a component of the Office of Student Affairs, the mission of the MSPHM is to empower students to become humanistic clinicians, scientists, leaders, and advocates.  However, our programmatic activities are open to all members of NYU, which means that students, faculty, and staff from diverse departments often sit alongside one another in seminars and other events. This facilitates dynamic dialogues and fosters personal and professional growth for all involved with the program.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe programmatic activities of the MSPHM cultivate the values of compassion, justice, empathy, and communication. These activities include Dialogues sessions with faculty who share their career trajectories and work in such areas as medical humanities, medical ethics, human rights, and health policy; exhibits featuring the artwork and photography of students and faculty; lectures with nationally recognized scholars, writers, and artists; film screenings and theatrical performances; visits to museums and historical sites; and collaborations with other programs in the broader NYU community.  Ultimately, our goal is to prepare students to make meaningful differences in the individual lives of patients and promote the health and well-being of our society.\",\n",

Infectious diseases make up 4 of the top 10 causes of death in the world.  They have an enormous impact regardless of income.  \\r\\n\\r\\nNew infectious diseases are developing with time, as we have seen with AIDS.  While treatment options and vaccines have made progress with all infectious diseases, treatment is also having a paradoxical impact with the development of drug resistant infections.  \\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless of what patients are hospitalized for,  hospital acquired infections can be devastating, and it is in the hospital setting where drug resistant infectious diseases are most prevalent.  Thus far, 2 million people in the US have died from nosocomial infections.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfectious diseases are the sole cause of epidemics.  We are keenly aware of their historic effect, particularly The Black Plague--which killed 100 million people, The 1918 Influenza Epidemic--which killed 17 million people, measles, smallpox, malaria, yellow fever, and repeated cholera epidemics.  We have seen them ourselves with AIDS--which has killed 25 million people since 1981--SARS, and the swine flu epidemic in 2009.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFew know, but Bellevue is the location of a TB ward.  TB is the only disease in the US in which you can be forcibly held if you refuse treatment.  \",\n",

The Integrative Medicine Club exposes medical professionals to a wide range of systems and therapies including homeopathy, massage, manual therapies, meditation, herbs, acupuncture, aromatherapy, diet and naturopathy, focusing on treatments best supported by clinical trials and scientific evidence. We hope to cover important drug-herb interactions, how CAM plays a critical role in ameliorating chronic health conditions, and how to understand medical illnesses from different perspectives. Join us as we explore how to incorporate these evidence-based therapies into conventional medical treatment regimens and approach each patients' health comprehensively, addressing emotional and spiritual wellbeing in addition to physical health.\",\n",

The IYSSE bases its political program on socialist internationalism. The IYSSE opposes imperialist war, social inequality and attacks on immigrants and democratic rights. The IYSSE calls for the nationalization of the banks and corporations and the reorganization of the world economy based on democratic workers’ control of the means of production. A socialist economy will be run on an egalitarian basis, not for profit but to meet the human needs of the world population.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IYSSE calls for students and youth to break from the Democrats and Republicans and those who seek to pressure them, and instead build an independent political movement based on the working class. On campus, the club provides students with a socialist perspective on current events and opposes all tendencies—including identity politics, post-modernism and nationalism—that divide the working class.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IYSSE works to raise the level of political discussion on campus through regular leafleting and meetings, and to win the most politically conscious students to a Marxist perspective in the fight against war and social inequality. Meetings will feature guest speakers, including writers for the World Socialist Web Site and experts in Marxist theory, and will discuss crucial topics, including the threat of war and the way forward for workers, students and youth. The IYSSE also works to orient students to the working class—leafleting with workers in New York City, including striking Spectrum workers, is integral to the work of the IYSSE.\\r\\n\",\n",

We help develop and support students’ and faculty interest in efforts towards interprofessional health education and practice. IPEG aims to increase the interprofessional health education and practice opportunities available to students. We also provide integrated educational experiences such as case studies, clinical experiences about health histories, physical examinations, labs, and diagnostics that are pertinent or of interest to members of the health care team.

It is on these grounds that we form our organization, whose central mission is to bring Reform Jewish students together through ritual practice, communal programming, and social action. Kesher’s door is open for all students to come as they are. We are a space in which members and non-members alike are invited to shape their Jewish identity, pursue social justice through Jewish values, observe the Jewish calendar, and live Torah. We are a space for exploration, education, and critical discourse. We believe in adaptation and in recognizing that it is not only possible, but in fact more holy to preserve our traditions while ensuring that they are inclusive and never prohibitive, exclusionary or demeaning towards any person. \\r\\n\\r\\nStatement of Inclusion\\r\\nKesher welcomes the full participation and protection of all who seek community. In accordance with our values, we do not discriminate or permit discrimination or harassment against any person or group of persons on the grounds of race, religion, color, sex, age, disability status, ethnicity, ancestry, national origin, socio-economic status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, marital status, familial status, pregnancy, veteran status, citizenship and/or genetic information. Furthermore, we welcome the full participation of Jews of all backgrounds including those from multi-faith and interfaith families, LGBTQ families, families with single parents, and those who are Jews by choice. We are proud of the diversity in our community.\\r\\n\\r\\nPronoun Statement\\r\\nOur organization is welcoming of all people and we are committed to ensuring that all people are seen and safe. One way we do this is by learning each other’s pronouns and always using each other’s correct pronouns. We do not assume anyone’s gender identity or pronouns based on appearance. We also know that there are more than two pronouns and we welcome the use of all pronouns including but not limited to she, he, they, ze, etc. If we hear someone use the wrong pronoun for someone else, we gently correct them. We hold ourselves accountable when we use the wrong pronoun and we commit to being aware.\",\n",

It is a member of the North-American Interfraternity Conference (NIC) and was founded by Warren A. Cole, while he was a student at Boston University, on November 2, 1909. The youngest of the fifteen largest social fraternities, Lambda Chi Alpha has initiated the third highest number of men ever, based on NIC statistics. Lambda Chi's National Headquarters is located in Indianapolis, Indiana.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Theta Upsilon Zeta chapter has a long, rich history starting from first being the Theta Lambda fraternity in 1920 when the school was named Polytechnic University. In the year 1925 the Theta Lambda fraternity was granted a merger with the Theta Kappa Nu fraternity. In 1939, the largest merger in fraternity history occurred between Theta Kappa Nu and Lambda Chi Alpha, resulting in 105 chapters and over 27,000 initiates. On October 11, 1939, the Theta Kappa Nu Chapter at Polytechnic University was granted the charter to be Theta Upsilon Zeta of Lambda Chi Alpha. This merger paved way for the future success and prosperity of the chapter. In 1940, the chapter was successful in purchasing the current house in Brooklyn Heights. On January 1st, 2014, Lambda Chi Alpha was absorbed by the New York University Inter Fraternity Council following the merger between New York University and the Polytechnic Institute. Currently, the chapter is strong at 35 active members with over 1000 initiates.\",\n",

Additionally, we hope to work with the D1 GDS and D2 CRI and CRII course coordinators to try to ensure that there will be at least one left-handed TA in each lab section. Further, we will hold tutorials aimed at helping students learn about and become comfortable with hand positions used for different procedures/teeth. As these tutorials will mostly serve the D1 and D2 students, we also hope to conduct lunch and learns that will be useful to all years. Topics may include facilitating work with associates and especially assistants whose dominant hand is opposite of those whom they work with, and improving dexterity in one’s non-dominant hand. Additionally, we will provide demonstrations on converting the operatories from the default right-handed dentist set-up to a left-handed dentist set-up. Consequently, the LHSA will make advice, guidance, resources, and hands-on instruction more accessible to left-handed dental students. \\r\\n\",\n",

The influx of Latinos and African American students created a need for an outlet in which their voices could be heard. Politically minded students came together and formed the League of Unified Cooperative Hispanic Americans. In 1994, the E-board of the already long established club decided to change the name of their organization. L.U.C.H.A became \\\"Latinos Unidos Con Honor Y Amistad,\\\" representing the struggle that breeds accomplishments and success for our people. Que Siga La L.U.C.H.A!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nMANIFESTO\\r\\n\\r\\nL.U.C.H.A, an organization for social, politcal, and cultural education, must struggle to bring about the necessary changes within NYU as well as our respective communities for the betterment of our society. Any further procrastination on our part will only leave our voices fixed, caught in a yoke of oppression. Our primary goal as an organization is to engage our thoughts, challenge conceptions and provoke new ideas for a better tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nGETTING INVOLVED\\r\\n\\r\\nL.U.C.H.A is a student-run organization and relies heavily on the support of incoming, as well as returning, students to keep its legacy alive. While we focus primarily on issues concerning Latinos, we encourage people of all cultural backgrounds to attend and participate in all of our meetings and major events. We encourage you to keep an eye out for our upcoming community service initatives and cosponsorships with other clubs on campus. If you have any concerns, questions, suggestions, or are interested in L.U.C.H.A, do not hesitate to contact us. \\r\\n\",\n",

Fifteen brave men saw the tyranny of songs such as these and said \\\"No more,\\\" as they threw off the shackles of classic a cappella. They stood for a new world, a world where a cappella could be fun again. A world where a cappella could be current. A world where a cappella wasn't just one of those things you could sleep through. That group was none other than NYU's original all male a cappella group: Mass Transit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMass Transit's mission has always been to make a cappella music accessible for a contemporary audience. Mass Transit is first and foremost a performance group, so every show is crafted to maximize the audience's enjoyment. The fifteen members (give or take a few depending on the year) of Mass Transit are constantly updating their set list to make their shows as relevant and enjoyable as possible. They've performed songs from a plethora of artists as diverse as The Arcade Fire to Lupe Fiasco, adding their own style and musicianship to create a fresh take on well known songs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMass Transit is synonymous with a good time, but, if you're not sold, check out our media tab for a taste of an actual performance.\",\n",

By allowing students to engage in professional debate, diplomacy and teamwork, we hope to better acquaint college students with the functions of national governments and the United Nations. We encourage a diversity of perspectives and welcome students of all backgrounds - law, history or even film production - to join our organization.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Weekly Meetings: we host a general meeting every week to allow members to discuss pressing global issues in a casual and supportive environment. A different member of our organization makes a short presentation at the beginning of each meeting, after which we debate and propose solutions on that topic. Past discussion topics have included UN Security Council reform, the Arab Spring and the role of Women in Combat.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Travel Team: our travel team attends Model UN conferences around the country and competes on the national circuit against most North American schools. We attend three conferences per semester, and typically send a delegation of between eight and 20 people to each conference. This is a valuable opportunity to meet students from around the world and discuss issues in a highly energetic and intellectual environment. We attend conferences at Columbia, Georgetown, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and other prominent universities. Our travel team was ranked #7 nationally in the Fall of 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. NYUMUNC: every year, our organization hosts a conference to explore a contemporary geopolitical issue and promote dialogue with other universities. As a staff member you will develop strong research, writing and creative skills and have the opportunity to interact with college students from around the country. You will be responsible for preparing background material and research documents in the lead up to the conference. You will also have to brainstorm creative scenarios in which government bodies and individuals must respond to domestic or foreign crises. Although a background/interest in political science, international relations or economics is helpful, some of our most dedicated members are language, journalism or film majors. For more information, visit http://www.nyumunc.org\\r\\n\\r\\n4. EmpireMUNC: for the first time in 2015, Model UN at NYU will be hosting a high school Model UN conference for the students of the surrounding area. Like NYUMUNC, this conference will focus on various aspects of international relations and give students the chance to learn more about international relations.

Additionally, the fraternity strives to work with various other Asian Greek organizations in an effort to bring unity and recognition to the Asian-American community.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternally, the fraternity emphasizes brotherhood and promotion of self-development for all of its members, as encouraged by its seven fundamental principles of brotherhood, discipline, leadership, pride, professionalism, service, and unity. Members are taught to use these principles in everyday life to promote personal growth. These ideals are brought upon prospective members, as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, the fraternity promotes brotherhood through events such as alumni networking, job banks, sports competitions, and road trips.

The NYCFC began as a partnership between the New York University School of Medicine and the Institute for Family Health to provide much needed care to the uninsured, homeless, and disenfranchised of greater New York. We believe that high-quality healthcare is the right of all individuals, families, and communities regardless of socioeconomic or health status. The only criterion to receive care at the NYCFC is that one be uninsured. A full range of healthcare services including primary care, specialty referrals, counseling, and patient education are available at the NYCFC. Additionally, the NYCFC offers prescription drugs at a significantly reduced cost to the patient, and incorporates free social services into patient care. Finally, the NYCFC endeavors to nurture the longstanding traditions of volunteerism and community service among healthcare professionals. The NYCFC is an all-volunteer group of medical students, undergraduates, physicians, and other healthcare professionals. The NYCFC strives to introduce the newest generation of healthcare professionals to the barriers associated with access to care for millions of New Yorkers alongside fostering a collaborative team-oriented approach to comprehensively addressing patients' needs and concerns. Opportunities for volunteering with the NYCFC are available. Please contact John Dankert (info@nycfreeclinic.org) with any questions or requests for information.\\r\\n\",\n",

A national single-payer system is one that is funded by the government, rather than private insurers, and ensures health care to ALL people. By educating students about single-payer health care and highlighting how this system alleviates some of the devastating downfalls of our current system we hope to inspire our students to explore ways in which we can make the health care system better for our patients. \\r\\nWe also provide opportunities for students to actively advocate for single-payer health care in New York State at local and regional events. Significant political activity has begun behind a state single-payer bill titled the NYS Health Bill. Due to our location, NYU students are in a great position to advocate for this bill and potentially affect real change on the NY state level. For too long health policy has been decided by private insurance companies, whose financial motives impinge upon our ability to provide the best treatment to patients. Through advocacy we can place more control in the hands of the physicians, the people who actually care about the health of the patient.\",\n",

After endless, sleepless nights he could think of no team that offered what he was looking for. Rishi took it upon himself to draw a group of talented individuals from New York University to create what would become the infamous Pandemonium. The idea was simple: Let's Do Hip Hop and Bhangra on the same stage, and mix it up with awesome and complex routines, colorful costumes, ridiculous stunts, unparalleled uniformity and choreo, and an awesome array of songs and mixes. Oh yeah, let's not forget that the infusion of a whole lot of adrenaline and testosterone. The team name \\\"Pandemonium\\\" was chosen after cleverly deciding that the Panda bear would be an iconic symbol of the best hip hop bhangra team in the world. The team's first performance was at Dance Fusion 2005 where they rocked the house. Always a crowd pleaser. Pandemonium is now nine years strong and counting and after performing at competitions in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, Austin, and Philadelphia, the sky is only the limit.\",\n",

While showcasing Latin dance traditions and integrating other Latin cultural elements (like food!), this club will serve as an opportunity to teach others our heritage and encourage pride in our backgrounds. Ritmo at NYU will host unique Latin dance performances each semester to illustrate this integral aspect of Latin culture to the NYU community. We meet twice a week to provide two key dance environments; one for those who feel comfortable learning dance routines and performing them on stage, and the other for those who don’t feel confident enough to perform, but want to learn new skills, improve their existing ones, or just wish to enjoy the camaraderie and lively environment that is Ritmo @ NYU. We hope you come dance with us!\",\n",

The staff provides a plethora of programming, so you will find plenty to do in Rubin at NYU and in NYC! Rubin is home to the following Explorations communities: Human Rights and International Relations, Spanish, French, and Fashion as well as a Choices (substance-free) community. We have several great amenities for residents to take advantage of including a large air conditioned second floor lounge, a black box theatre, a study lounge, a dance room, a piano room, a ping pong room, and a billiards room. Rubin also has a water bottle filling station on the second floor which provides filtered and cool water that helps keep our residents hydrated. At Rubin, we have a tradition of having the most spirited hall government, which we affectionately refer to as SUG@R (Student Undergraduate Government At Rubin). We encourage everyone to get involved in the Rubin community, whether that means running for President of SUG@R, being a floor representative, or attending our fun programs.\",\n",

Sing for Hope’s programs include collaborative concerts for hospital patients, after-school arts classes for at-risk youth, and its flagship public art initiative, The Sing for Hope Pianos, which reaches an estimated 2 million New Yorkers and visitors every year. A celebration of Sing for Hope’s vision of art for all, this beloved public art project brings artist-designed pianos to the parks and public spaces of NYC for two weeks each summer, then moves the instruments to permanent homes in the schools, healthcare facilities, and community organizations that Sing for Hope serves year-round. Sing for Hope is defined by the volunteerism of artists, the needs of the community, and the belief in the power of the arts to uplift, unite, and transform.\",\n",

The SDI is a collective group of diverse students, who have united in an effort to strengthen the institutional mission and commitment to providing an atmosphere of diversity and inclusion across the medical campus. To truly produce diversity, one must understand that it is not just about the number of individuals represented from disparate groups; it is about developing a community of people from all backgrounds who accept, value and celebrate what diversity can do for the institution and its members. Through recruitment, mentoring, fundraising, and providing forums to openly discuss issues of diversity, we will provide an opportunity for all students to grow and learn from the differences found in each other; but more importantly, we will provide a way to connect through our similarities and common interests.  To be expanded and impacted by diversity, one must reflect on their own fears and biases, seek to understand the root of these misconceptions, and learn to value the opportunity to learn and grow alongside a diverse group of peers. Regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, or disability, there is a place at NYUSoM for each and every person.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitiatives:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

Together these two buildings make up the 7A Partnership.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Green House consists mostly of quads, where four residents share some of the largest apartments on campus. The rooms have large closets and plenty of space for studying in your room. Common areas have a fridge, sink, and cabinets as well as a couch, table, and chairs. The Green House has recently renovated lounges: a communal TV lounge with a beautiful kitchen, a study lounge, and a game room with table tennis and foosball. There is also a bike storage room on the first floor, as well as a Green House lending library. Laundry is in the basement.\\r\\n\\r\\nTthe Green House offers residents a number of great opportunities to get involved in sustainability efforts in the NYU and New York communities. All of our residents are involved in one of our three Branches: Communal Dinners, Community Service (through local community gardens and our own Green House Garden), and Communal Living (which focuses on programming and improvements to the building).\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo Faculty Affiliates partner with the RAs to bring interesting programming to the Green House.

However, with the development of endovascular technologies and continued innovations in surgical and imaging techniques, vascular surgery is now considered a specialty in its own right, distinct from other surgical subspecialties. The Vascular Surgery Interest Group (VSIG) seeks to cultivate enthusiasm and excitement for this rapidly advancing field that has only now become an immediate career option for medical school graduates. Many students have never been exposed to vascular surgery and have little knowledge regarding the diversity of patients, breadth of conditions, options for training, and promising future for this field.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince NYU is home to many influential vascular surgeons who have and continue to make great contributions to the field, VSIG is primely positioned to provide dinner lectures, panel discussions, conference funding, and other resources to promote exposure to vascular technologies and offer invaluable sources of inspiration and information for all who participate. In addition, collaborative efforts with other clinical clubs, such as the general surgery, radiology, and cardiology interest groups, will also help to clarify the different roles and approaches to patients that makes each specialty distinct from one another.\",\n",

In the sub-cellar there are music practice rooms with pianos, a laundry room, and three classrooms, which can also double as study lounges. We have many dining options: Passport Dining @ Weinstein Dining Hall (aka \\\"Downstein\\\"), the Food Court (aka \\\"Upstein\\\"), the Kosher cafeteria, and Peet's Coffee shop. Our hall also features a very active hall government called the Weinstein Hall Advisory Team, or better known as W.H.A.T., that advocates for fellow residents and also plans great events throughout the year. Check out our blog to learn more about Weinstein!\",\n",

      "    \"description\": \"WNYU’s mission is to provide our tri-state listening community, defined by our signal’s reach, with educational alternative radio programming. The FCC mandates that non-commercial college radio licensees must provide such an alternative. Alternative is relative to your market, including the commercial market: people listen to the radio, not exclusively commercial or non-commercial radio. So when we program the station, we consider the entire radio market and determine if programming of a similar nature exists within our listening community. We want to make programming sense by offering listening alternatives. If you hear it on another station, you probably won’t hear it on WNYU.\\r\\n\\r\\nWNYU is a 24 hour-a-day, 365 day-a-year student managed and staffed operation: we maintain and transmit a signal constantly. We are committed to addressing the needs and concerns of our immediate NYU student and village population through direct participation and interaction. We educate and entertain our community with unique music, news and student-produced shows exclusive to WNYU but with interest beyond the campus and the Village.\\r\\n\\r\\nWNYU encourages student participation from all schools within NYU. Drawing from this diverse environment, WNYU remains fresh and daring, uninhibited by commercial pressures. We don’t have to get a “ten-share” to stay on the air. That is not to say that we don’t have a professional attitude, but it is to say that we take full advantage of our non-commercial obligations and opportunities. We can program what other stations can’t even imagine.\",\n",

Young Democratic Socialists at NYU is NYU's chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, America's largest socialist organization. We at NYU YDSA believe that a group to discuss, learn, and advocate for a different kind of society is necessary in the face of the historical moment we are living through. As democratic socialists, we believe that both the economy and society should be run democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few. We are a political and activist organization, not a party; we are a big-tent organization that treats politics as a learning experience rather than a dogma; we use a variety of tactics, from legislative to direct action, to fight for reforms that empower working people. NYU's chapter will draw from the breadth of ideas and experience of the national organization, while speaking to our concerns as students located in one of the most progressive and unequal cities in the nation. This is an urgent time, and we want an open and inclusive space for students at NYU to hear and debate new political ideas, to learn about activism and how different struggles can move forward together, and to support each other and all those who lose out from the current order.\",\n",
