      "This course introduces data structures. Topics include program specifications and design; abstract data types; stacks, queues; dynamic storage allocation; sequential and linked implementation of stacks and queues; searching methods, sequential and binary; binary trees and general trees; hashing; computational complexity; sorting algorithms: selection sort, heap sort, mergesort and quicksort; comparison of sorting techniques and analysis. | Prerequisite: Graduate Standing, CS-GY 5303 *Online version available.\n",
      "This course presents an overview of fundamental data structures, which are commonplace in programming, as well as associated basic algorithms. Complexity analysis, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hashing, sorting, and basic graphs algorithms are covered. Core topics such as Floydâ€™s algorithm, minimum spanning tree algorithms, and branch and bound techniques are also covered. Practical lab exercises complement the lectures. The students further specialize and consolidate their knowledge through lab projects to demonstrate the operation and applications of various data structures.\n",
